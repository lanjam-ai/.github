### What is LanJAM?

LanJAM gives your family a shared AI assistant that runs entirely on your own hardware. Every conversation, every file, every piece of data stays on your local network — nothing is ever sent to the cloud.

- **Private by design** — your data never leaves your network
- **Family-friendly** — role-based safety system with age-appropriate content filtering
- **Multi-user** — each family member gets their own account with isolated data
- **Offline-capable** — fully functional without internet after initial setup
- **Open source** — inspect, modify, and contribute to every line of code
